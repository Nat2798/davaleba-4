        <h3>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h3>
        <span>12.02.2020</span>
        <p>
            <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's 
            standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type 
            specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining 
            essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum 
            passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

        <h3>Where does it come from?</h3>

        <p>
            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical 
            Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at 
            Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum 
            passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. 
            Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" 
            (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, 
            very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a 
            line in section 1.10.32.
        </p>

        <h3>Why do we use it?</h3>
        <span>07.07.2020</span>
        <p>
            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at 
            its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed 
            to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and 
            web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many 
            web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on 
            purpose (injected humour and the like).

        <p>
            There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some 
            form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a 
            passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All 
            the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first 
            true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model 
            sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always 
            free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
